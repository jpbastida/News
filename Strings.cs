        public string FirstNews = (@"The Kremlin has praised the professionalism of Rex Tillerson, thought to beDonald Trump’s leading contender for 
secretary of state, the ExxonMobil CEO who has forged close ties to Russia.
“On account of his work as the head of one of the largest oil companies, he had contacts with our representatives more than once,” P
resident Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists on Monday. “He fulfills his responsibilities in a highly professional manner.”
Peskov also said “there’s a big difference being secretary of state and directing even a very big company” and that the Kremlin hoped for a 
“readiness to demonstrate a constructive attitude and display professionalism” from Washington.
Putin had hosted Tillerson on several occasions, Peskov added. The Russian president honoured the oil executive with an order of friendship 
award in 2013.
Although Trump has not yet nominated Tillerson, several news outlets have reported he is likely to do so in the next few days.");

        public string SecondNews = (@"A survivor of a plane crash in Colombia that killed 71 people says the pilot never told passengers to 
fasten their seatbelt before the aircraft smashed into a hillside.
Brazilian radio journalist Rafael Henzel spoke with Fantastico program Sunday night from Colombia, where he is recovering.
“At no point did someone from the cabin or the crew tell us, ‘Put on your seatbelts’,” said Henzel. “We just kept flying without any 
idea of what was about to happen.”
The plane took off from Santa Cruz, Bolivia and crashed near the airport in Medellín, Colombia on 28 November. Only six of the 77 passengers 
on board survived. The dead included 19 members of the Chapecoense soccer club from southern Brazil and 20 of the journalists covering the team. 
The survivors were two Bolivian crew members and four Brazilians – Henzel and three soccer players.
Investigations have been launched in Brazil, Bolivia and Colombia. Colombian authorities have said they believe a lack of fuel caused the crash.
Henzel said that toward the end of the flight, passengers around him began asking how long it would be before they landed.
“Ten minutes” was the response from the crew, he said. “Then suddenly, the lights went off and the engines went off.”
At that point, everyone rushed back to their seats and fastened their seatbelts, said Henzel. Then the plane crashed into a hillside.
Henzel said when he awoke, there were emergency workers around him and he was in immense pain from what turned out to be seven broken ribs. 
He called out to the colleagues who had been sitting on each side of him, but they had died.
He said he believed he survived thanks to a miracle and the good fortune to wake up just as emergency workers passed by.
Henzel said he was sickened to learn the cause of the accident was likely a lack of fuel.

        public string ThirdNews = (@"Mourners have paid their respects to the victims of Sunday’s attack on the seat of Coptic Christianity in Egypt, 
as the Coptic pope sought to heal sectarian frictions amid rising anger from a minority that claims it is insufficiently protected. 
The attack on St Peter and St Paul church, adjoining Cairo’s St Mark’s Cathedral, took place during Sunday morning prayers and killed 24 people, 
most of them women and children, according to an updated toll issued by the health ministry on Monday. At least 45 others were injured. 
There has been no claim of responsibility.
President Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi named a 22-year-old, Mahmoud Shafik Mohamed Mostafa, as the alleged perpetrator of the suicide attack. 
He said other people, including one woman, had been arrested over their alleged involvement.
As mourners crowded into the Virgin Mary and St Athanasius church in Cairo on Monday, the Coptic pope, Tawadros II, attempted to focus on 
the unity of Egypt’s grief, denouncing the blast as “not just a disaster for the church but a disaster for the whole nation”.
